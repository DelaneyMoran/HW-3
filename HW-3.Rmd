## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Kyler, Christian
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 6 hours
* What gave you the most trouble:
* Any comments you have: 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```


## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to predict individual's gender and interpret the results for one continuous variable (if you used one) and one categorical variable of your choice.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
profiles <- mutate(profiles, is_female = ifelse(sex == "f", 1, 0))

bodytype <- profiles %>% 
  select(body_type, is_female) %>% 
  group_by(body_type) %>% 
  mutate(sum = sum(is_female),
         prop_female = mean(is_female)) %>% 
  distinct(body_type) %>% 
  arrange(prop_female)
  
modeldata <- profiles %>% 
  mutate(full_curvy = ifelse(body_type %in% c("curvy", "full figured"), 1, 0),
         health_edu_cler = ifelse(job %in% c("medicine / health", "education / academia", "clerical / administrative"), 1, 0)) %>% 
  na.omit(height)

model1 <- glm(is_female ~ full_curvy + health_edu_cler + height, data = modeldata, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
summary(model1)

```
####Not sure I did this right...So if the respondent says s/he is curvy or full-figured there is a 356% increase in the likelihood s/he is female? Am I supposed to take i/e^3.56? 

####Also is there a more attractive way to display this information?

### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#fitted values
co <- coefficients(model1)
hist(fitted(model1))

```


### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

threshold <- 0.5
predicted_sex <- modeldata %>% 
  mutate(predicted_fem = ifelse(fitted(model1) > threshold, 1, 0))

table <- predicted_sex %>% 
  group_by(is_female, predicted_fem) %>% 
  tally()
knitr::kable(head(table), format = "markdown")

```
####As expected, there is more type 2 (more people predicted as men but who are actually female) due to the choice of predictor variables; they are highly associated with being female, but only apply to a small sub-set of people.

### d) BONUS

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

jukebox1 <- jukebox %>% 
  mutate(date_time2 = parse_date_time(date_time, "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y"))

jukebox2 <- jukebox1 %>%
  mutate(year = year(date_time2),
         month = month(date_time2),
         day = day(date_time2),
         week = week(date_time2)) %>% 
  group_by(week, year) %>% 
  tally()

ggplot(jukebox2, aes(x = week, y = n, color = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Number of songs played") 

```


## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

jukebox3 <- jukebox1 %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date_time2), 
         month = month(date_time2), 
         day = day(date_time2),
         hour = hour(date_time2), 
         minute = minute(date_time2),
         second = second(date_time2))

graveyard <- jukebox3 %>% 
  filter(hour < 8) %>%
  filter(month >8 | month <6) %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(-n)

knitr::kable(head(graveyard, 10), format = "markdown")    
  

```


## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

bitcoin <- Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD") %>% tbl_df()
bitcoin <- rename(bitcoin, Avg = `24h Average`, Total.Volume = `Total Volume`)



```

####Haven't gotten a chance to do this yet!



## Question 5: OPTIONAL

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
```
