## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW:
* What gave you the most trouble:
* Any comments you have: 





## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset. For the R Markdown to work, you must first
copy the file `profiles.csv` from Lec09 to the project directory `HW-3`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% tbl_df()
```


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression and
interpret all results

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```


### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```

### c)

Using a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$, set up a contingency table of .

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```

### d)

Say we wanted to have a false positive rate of 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
jukebox <- read.csv("jukebox.csv", header=TRUE)
```

For each academic year between 2003-2004 thru 2008-2009, who were the top 10 artists played?  Define

* the start of academic year as the first Tuesday in September
* the end of the academic year as the last Monday in January plus 15 weeks plus 4 days (i.e. the Friday of that week)

You can find these dates manually, or with the help of lubridate functions, or entirely using lubrdiate functions.  Display the results in easily digestible format.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 3:

Plot a time series of the number of songs played each week.  What patterns do you observe?  

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 4:

We want to study the volatility of bitcoin prices.  Let our measure of
volatility be the *relative* change from day-to-day in price.  For which
periods since 2013/01/01 did we see the most volatility?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 5:

Compare the volatility of bitcoin prices with the volatility of the price of
gold for the same time period.  What do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 6:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB")
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB")
```
