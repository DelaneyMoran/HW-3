## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Kyler, Christian, Aminata
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 9 hours
* What gave you the most trouble:
* Any comments you have: 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```


## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to predict individual's gender and interpret the results for one continuous variable (if you used one) and one categorical variable of your choice.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
profiles <- mutate(profiles, is_female = ifelse(sex == "f", 1, 0))

bodytype <- profiles %>% 
  select(body_type, is_female) %>% 
  group_by(body_type) %>% 
  mutate(sum = sum(is_female),
         prop_female = mean(is_female)) %>% 
  distinct(body_type) %>% 
  arrange(prop_female)
  
modeldata <- profiles %>% 
  mutate(full_curvy = ifelse(body_type %in% c("curvy", "full figured"), 1, 0),
         health_edu_cler = ifelse(job %in% c("medicine / health", "education / academia", "clerical / administrative"), 1, 0)) %>% 
  na.omit(height)

model1 <- glm(is_female ~ full_curvy + health_edu_cler + height, data = modeldata, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
knitr::kable(summary(model1)$coef, digits=2)

```

Being curvy or full-figured is associated with an increase of exp(3.56) in the odds of being female.
Working in clerical, education, and healthcare is associated with an increase of exp(0.88) in the odds of being female.
Every increase of an inch in height is associated with a decrease of exp(0.63) in the odds of being female.


### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

#fitted values
co <- coefficients(model1)
hist(fitted(model1))

```


### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

threshold <- 0.5
predicted_sex <- modeldata %>% 
  mutate(predicted_fem = ifelse(fitted(model1) > threshold, 1, 0))

table <- predicted_sex %>% 
  mutate(sex = ifelse(is_female == 0, "male", "female"),
         predicted_sex = ifelse(predicted_fem == 0, "predicted male", "predicted female")) %>% 
  group_by(sex, predicted_sex) %>% 
  tally()
  
table2 <- table %>%
  spread(sex, n)

knitr::kable(table2)

```
Approximately 85% of females were predicted correctly.


### d) BONUS

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

jukebox <- jukebox %>% 
  mutate(date_time2 = parse_date_time(date_time, "%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y"))

jukebox2 <- jukebox %>%
  mutate(month = month(date_time2),
        year = year(date_time2),
         day = day(date_time2),
         week = week(date_time2)) %>% 
  group_by(year, week) %>% 
  tally()

ggplot(jukebox2, aes(x = week, y = n, color = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Number of songs played") 

ggplot(jukebox2, aes(x = week, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 7) +
  ylab("Number of songs played") +
  geom_smooth(se = 0)

```


## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

jukebox4 <- jukebox %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date_time2), 
         month = month(date_time2), 
         day = day(date_time2),
         hour = hour(date_time2), 
         minute = minute(date_time2),
         second = second(date_time2))

graveyard <- jukebox4 %>% 
  filter(hour < 8) %>%
  filter(month >8 | month <6) %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(-n)

knitr::kable(head(graveyard, 10), format = "markdown")    
  

```


## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

bitcoin <- Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD") %>% tbl_df()
bitcoin <- rename(bitcoin, bc_Avg = `24h Average`) %>% 
  select(Date, bc_Avg) %>% 
  mutate(bc_prev_day = lag(bc_Avg),
         bc_percent_change = 100*((bc_Avg - bc_prev_day)/bc_prev_day))


gold <- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD") %>% tbl_df()
gold <- rename(gold, gold_val = Value) %>% 
  mutate(gold_prev_day = lag(gold_val),
         gold_percent_change = 100*((gold_val - gold_prev_day)/gold_prev_day))

gold_bc <- inner_join(gold, bitcoin, by = "Date")

ggplot(gold_bc) +
  geom_line(aes(Date, bc_percent_change), na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_line(aes(Date, gold_percent_change), na.rm = TRUE, color = "gold") +
  ylab("Percent Change") +
  ggtitle("Bitcoin and Gold Price Volatility 2010-present")

```

Percent change by day of bitcoin prices is shown in black and percent change in gold prices is shown in gold. Note that bitcoin prices are much more volatile.



## Question 5: OPTIONAL

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
```
